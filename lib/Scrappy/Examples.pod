=head1 WHAT IS SCRAPPY

Scrappy is an easy (and hopefully fun) way of scraping, spidering, and/or
harvesting information from web pages. Internally Scrappy uses the awesome
Web::Scraper and WWW::Mechanize modules so as such Scrappy imports its
awesomeness. Scrappy is inspired by the fun and easy-to-use Dancer API. Beyond
being a pretty API for WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Web::Scraper, Scrappy also has its
own featuer-set which makes web scraping easier and more enjoyable.

Scrappy (pronounced Scrap+Pee) == 'Scraper Happy' or 'Happy Scraper'; If you
like you may call it Scrapy (pronounced Scrape+Pee) although Python has a web
scraping framework by that name and this module is not a port of that one.

=head1 BASIC SCRAPPY USAGE

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Scrappy qw/:syntax/;
        
    # always initialize a new scrappy instance first
    init;
    
    # pick a user-agent, any user-agent
    user_agent random_ua;
    
    # get page from URL
    get 'http://search.cpan.org/recent';
    
    if (loaded) {
        var date    => grab '.datecell b';
        var modules => grab '#cpansearch li a', { name => 'TEXT', link => '@href' };
    }
    
    # the list function deferences, list == @{...}
    print $_->{name}, "\n" for list var->{modules};
